# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I am a Masters Student at the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.uml.edu/engineering/electrical-computer/programs/graduate/masters-computer.aspx) department of [University of Massachusetts Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/engineering/electrical-computer/programs/graduate/masters-computer.aspx). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.umb.edu/academics/program-finder/computer-science-bs/) at [University of Massachusetts Boston](https://www.umb.edu/academics/program-finder/computer-science-bs/).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests lie primarily in the Biomedical Field. Currently, I am researching the segementations of the spine using Machine Learning and AI to detect the disks. Creating a pipeline for doctors to view the 3D model version of the CT scan of any specific patient.

I'm also learning web development and building machine learning softwares and systems.
